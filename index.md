## Professional Resume

My career in software engineering began in 2008 while working for a local printing company. This one of my first "real adult" jobs and it showed me how technology could be used to make valuable business products aswell as the importance of good design. It sparked a desire in me to pursue a career that would allow to use technology to build things that were as useful as they were beatiful.
